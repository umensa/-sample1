#Base64
From time to time in your programming career, you'll need to deal with binary encoding.
One of the many ways to encode binary data to text is using the base 64 encoding scheme.
A binary encoding scheme will represent binary data in a text format.
We mainly use this when sending binary data across a medium which expects text data, like when requesting web sites across a network.
There are severan encoding formats available for this and, programmatically, many function the same way.
