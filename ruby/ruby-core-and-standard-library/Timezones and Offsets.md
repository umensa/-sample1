#Timezones and Offsets
When we've been working with dates and times so far, we haven't been worrying about time zones.
Different parts of the world use something called an offset when taking time in to account.
You probably have friends or relatives in a different timezone and may need to mentally subtract or add hours so you call them at a reasonable time of day.
The same thing happens in Ruby when working with time zones.
