#Include
If we want to mix in behavior to a class, we have to use the include method.
Unsurprisingly, based on the name, that will include all of the methods in the module in the class that weâ€™re working with.
In order to make our modules actually do something, it needs to be included in a class.

##Techer's Notes
**Code Samples**
Here is our `Fetcher` module:

`module Fetcher
  def fetch(item)
    puts "I'll bring that #{item} right back!"
  end
end`

Once written, we can include that in the Dog class:

`class Dog
  include Fetcher
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end`
`
dog = Dog.new("Fido")
dog.fetch("ball")`
