#What Are Ruby Gems?
In Ruby, a gem is a library that contains a specific piece of functionality as well as any files or assets related to that functionality.
Gems can be found for all sorts of common functionality in an application -- things like handling money and currency, integrating with credit card processing, tools to make ruby coding even easier, and more.
You could write these things yourself but one big benefit to using a gem instead is that it saves time.
