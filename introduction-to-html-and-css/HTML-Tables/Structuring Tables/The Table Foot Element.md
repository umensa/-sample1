#The Table Foot Element
In general a table footer element should contain a summary of the table. This might be some final cells that are sums, totals, and averages for each column. A table footer might also just contain some meta information about the table itself, such as how frequently the table is updated, copyright information, or perhaps the source of the data within the table.
