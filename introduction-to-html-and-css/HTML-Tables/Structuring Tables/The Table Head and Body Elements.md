#The Table Head and Body Elements
The table head element is a completely different element from the table header cell element. In combination with the table body element, the table will gain additional structure.

##Teacher's Notes

**HTML Elements**

   * <thead> - The table head element (not to be confused with the table header cell element) defines a set of rows that make up the header of a table.
   * <tbody> - The table body element defines one or more rows that make up the primary contents (or "body") of a table.
